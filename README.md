# TripleCamel
A simple Android app to check Amazon price history on CamelCamelCamel.

This app works like this: display a product in the Amazon app, push the Share button and select TripleCamel as the app to share to. You will be redirected to CamelCamelCamel at the page of that product. That's it!

This app is not affiliated with CamelCamelCamel. For more information, visit their <a href="http://camelcamelcamel.com/">website</a>.

This app is developed by Ermanno Baschiera (ebaschiera@gmail.com). This software is GPLv3.

Since version 1.0.8 no user data will be tracked at all. Before 1.0.8 I tracked app usage with Piwik analytics, without collecting personal data.
